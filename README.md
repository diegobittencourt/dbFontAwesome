# dbFontAwesome

This project came about from needing to add a bunch of icon buttons to a Windows Forms project.

The dbFontAwesome project in the solution creates a DLL that you can use in any windows forms and web project.

Font Awesome (see http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is already embedded. There is no need to install the font on the client machine.

The IconType enum contains a few icon codes.
